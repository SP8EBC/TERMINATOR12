# TERMINATOR12

This ought to be a silly recreation of Indra PEGASUS_21 (Polish Enhanced Generation ATC System for Unified Solutions of 21st Century). The operational software used by Polish Airspace Navigation Services Agency, to display live traffic in controller & uncontrolled airspace, used as a main tool used by Air Traffic Controller. Because unfortunately I don't have any direct connection to PANSA's internal LAN, to get data feed from PSR/SSR network it will display data from OGN/FANET/FLARM receivers and ADS-B/ModeS 1090MHz receivers :(. 

_Because using a mouse as a pointing device is only for kids and sissy boys, ParaATC will use VIM-like keyboard command extensively._
